Breif Review: I made the Catering Page and photos did the nav and little bit of the footer
Puppy Restaurant
Peer Review: Michael Pantoja: Everything works fine when i went to change the size on mobile the catering picture went away other then that the website looks great and the reacts how it should

It looks like it was designed for 1440, but the prototype is 1920

Navbar - 
	Navbar and content are all too small. Nav link's are to close together.

Home Page:
	Muzzels Sandwich -
		To much space on the sides, content isn't wide enough. Line height for the text is to much. It looks like there isn't emougth text for this section.

About Page:
	Everything on this page is too squished together, to much space on the sides. Nothing links properly from About Page.
	
	Story behind the Grill - 
		The line height is larger on here than the prototype. Text looks a little small. Not enough padding on the right side of the text. Not enough space on the bottom of the text.

	Our Team - 
		Our Team title doesn't have enough padding on top or bottom of the text. Team cards are too thin, and spaced too far apart. Cards should have border-radius: 0; Not enough space underneath cards, above footer.

Menu:
	Our Menu -
		Different font, and too much margin on the sides. 
	Cards - 
		Unfinished

Catering: 
	Catering - 
		Different font. To much margin on the sides. 
	Header Image - 
		Too tall and not wide enough
	Our Catering Services - 
		The spacing above and below this section is too small. Title font is different. Line height is too much, looks like there isn't enought text.
	Rest of page - 
		Unfinished

Photos:
	Photos - 
		Different font. Pictures are too small and spaced to far apart from each other and from the title. Border is too small. No footer.

Responsiveness: 
	Navbar is responsive, except on Catering. Our team cards. Partly the menu cards on menu. Catering and Photos are okay.
